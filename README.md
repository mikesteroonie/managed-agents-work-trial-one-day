# Managed agents

AgentMail gives agents email inboxes. We want customers to create agents that work with incoming email without building and hosting a separate service for each one.

## The problem

Customers know the job they want an agent to do, but getting it running also requires connecting an inbox, executing instructions, retaining state, and understanding what happened. Build a **Managed Agents** section in the AgentMail console that handles that setup and operation.

Build for someone creating email agents for their team or customers. Rho, whose team wants to create agents for its customers, is one example. The product should support different instructions and use cases without application-code changes for each one.

## What we'd like you to build

Assume the user is already logged in and has an AgentMail workspace, inboxes, and API credentials. Managed Agents belongs in the existing console sidebar. **AgentMail is the only connector; incoming `message.received` events trigger the agents.**

Keep configuration to three inputs:

- **Name:** a label for finding the agent later.
- **Instructions:** one Markdown document containing the task and useful context. Support writing or pasting text; importing an `.md` file is optional.
- **Inbox:** one existing AgentMail inbox whose incoming emails trigger the agent.

The model and available AgentMail tools are fixed for the trial. Make their capabilities understandable without adding settings for them. You choose the interaction flow, guidance, validation feedback, and how much detail to expose.

### Frontend

- Create and save an agent with those three inputs.
- List saved agents and reopen their configuration. Show the linked inbox and whether the agent is ready to receive email events.
- Inspect the latest run: input, status, output, tool activity, and any error.
- Retain saved configuration and results after refreshing or returning later.

Latest-run inspection is sufficient. Editing existing agents and pause/resume are outside this assignment.

### Backend

- Build application APIs and a Postgres schema to create, list, and retrieve saved agents and their latest run data. You choose the route structure, validation, tables, and relationships.
- Use the supplied AgentMail client for inbox/message access and agent tool bindings. Implement webhook registration, the receiving endpoint, event parsing/validation, and inbox-to-agent routing using AgentMail's existing services.
- Trigger the supplied execution harness from incoming events and persist results, status, tool activity, and failures for the UI. Execution must not depend on someone pressing Run.

Execution within the local event-handler request is acceptable.

Create synthetic payloads matching the documented webhook contract and a small local replay script that posts them to your receiving endpoint. It should exercise the same event-handling path as live delivery. Local replay is sufficient for the demo; see the [AgentMail integration guide](docs/AGENTMAIL.md) for endpoints and testing details.

### When an execution fails

A customer relying on an agent needs to understand what happened and what they can do next when it fails.

Handle **one terminal run failure reported by the supplied harness**, from persisted application state to a clear explanation and usable next step in the UI. Retain useful input/activity and failure information. The harness owns the agent loop and recovery within it; you do not implement tool retries. A recovered tool error can still produce a successful run. You choose what the customer can do after a terminal failure; starting a new run is optional.

Be prepared to discuss what would happen if the execution process stopped before recording a result, or an event arrived again. Automatic crash recovery and concurrent duplicate-delivery guarantees are outside the required build.

## What we provide

Next.js/TypeScript and a console shell, an empty Postgres database, a configured **server-side AgentMail SDK client**, trial credentials, and a local execution harness with model access and predictable test modes. Use the harness's local action-recording mode when testing generated email actions.

You own the product screens, application APIs, schema, event handling, and execution integration. The [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md), [AgentMail endpoint guide](docs/AGENTMAIL.md), and [harness contract](docs/HARNESS.md) describe the starter and its preparation status. Keep credentials server-side and out of source control.

## Boundaries

Keep this to one existing workspace and email agents. Authentication, additional connectors, model settings, tool-permission editors, document management, arbitrary-code hosting, workflow builders, and cloud deployment are outside scope. Use AgentMail's existing webhook service; do not build a delivery service.

## Questions to consider

- How will someone know what the agent can do and whether it is ready?
- What should they see first in a result, and which details should be available on demand?
- Why do your data model and API boundaries fit this experience?
- What can the customer safely do next after your chosen failure?

## Working together

Start with a sketch of the user flow and technical approach. Discuss it with us, then spend most of the trial building. Ask questions and surface blockers as you go.

Demonstrate different user-defined instructions through the same creation, email-triggered execution, and inspection flow. We'll have someone try the product so you can observe it and make an adjustment.

Keep brief [design notes](DECISIONS.md) and commands for running and checking your work. AI tools and existing components are welcome; be ready to explain and modify what you build.
