# Managed agents

AgentMail gives agents email inboxes. We want customers to create agents that work with incoming email without building and hosting a separate service for each one.

## The problem

Customers know the job they want an agent to do, but getting it running also requires connecting an inbox, executing instructions, retaining state, and understanding what happened. Build a **Managed Agents** section in the AgentMail console that handles that setup and operation.

Build for someone creating email agents for their team or customers. Rho, whose team wants to create agents for its customers, is one example. The product should support different instructions and use cases without application-code changes for each one.

## What we'd like you to build

Assume the user is already logged in and has an AgentMail workspace, inboxes, and API credentials. Managed Agents belongs in the existing console sidebar. **AgentMail is the only connector; incoming `message.received` events trigger the agents.**

Keep configuration to three inputs:

- **Name:** a label for finding the agent later.
- **Instructions:** one Markdown document containing the task and useful context. Support writing or pasting text; importing an `.md` file is optional.
- **Inbox:** one existing AgentMail inbox whose incoming emails trigger the agent.

The model and available AgentMail tools are fixed for the trial. Make their capabilities understandable without adding settings for them. You choose the interaction flow, guidance, validation feedback, and how much detail to expose.

### Frontend

- Create and save an agent with those three inputs.
- List saved agents and reopen their configuration. Show the linked inbox and whether the agent is ready to receive email events.
- Show the latest run's status, final output, and an error if it failed.
- Retain saved configuration and results after refreshing or returning later.

The latest outcome is sufficient. Editing existing agents and pause/resume are outside this assignment.

### Backend

- Build application APIs and a Postgres schema to create, list, and retrieve saved agents and their latest run data. You choose the route structure, validation, tables, and relationships.
- Use the supplied AgentMail client for inbox/message access and agent tool bindings. Implement webhook registration, the receiving endpoint, event parsing/validation, and inbox-to-agent routing using AgentMail's existing services.
- Trigger the supplied execution harness from incoming events and persist the latest run's status, final output, and any terminal error for the UI. Execution must not depend on someone pressing Run.

Execution within the local event-handler request is acceptable. You choose the execution architecture; a separate worker or queue is optional.

Use the supplied replay script and signing helper to post sample events to your local receiving endpoint. Create payload variants to test your implementation. Local replay is sufficient for the demo; see the [AgentMail integration guide](docs/AGENTMAIL.md) for details.

### Product behavior

Anticipate edge cases and failure modes across setup, saving, execution, and interpreting results. Prioritize those that matter for this product, implement appropriate behavior, and explain any remaining limitations. Keep the customer experience consistent with what the backend knows.

The supplied harness owns the agent loop and recovery within it. You own the application around it, including how its outcomes are stored and presented.

## What we provide

Next.js/TypeScript and a console shell, an empty Postgres database, a configured **server-side AgentMail SDK client**, trial credentials, and a local execution harness with model access and predictable test modes. Use the harness's local action-recording mode when testing generated email actions.

You own the product screens, application APIs, schema, event handling, and execution integration. The [setup guide](docs/SETUP.md) covers the planned starter and execution harness; the [AgentMail endpoint guide](docs/AGENTMAIL.md) lists integration points. Keep credentials server-side and out of source control.

## Boundaries

Keep this to one existing workspace and email agents. Authentication, additional connectors, model settings, tool-permission editors, document management, arbitrary-code hosting, workflow builders, and cloud deployment are outside scope. Use AgentMail's existing webhook service; do not build a delivery service.

## Questions to consider

- How will someone know what the agent can do and whether it is ready?
- What should a customer understand from the latest result?
- Why do your data model and API boundaries fit this experience?
- Which edge cases matter most here, and what should the customer experience when they occur?

## Working together

Start with a sketch of the user flow and technical approach. Discuss it with us, then spend most of the trial building. Ask questions and surface blockers as you go.

Demonstrate different user-defined instructions through the same creation, email-triggered execution, and inspection flow. We'll have someone try the product so you can observe it and make an adjustment.

Keep brief [design notes](DECISIONS.md) and commands for running and checking your work. AI tools and existing components are welcome; be ready to explain and modify what you build.
