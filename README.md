# Managed agents

AgentMail gives agents email inboxes. Build a **Managed Agents** section in the AgentMail console where customers can configure agents that respond to incoming email, without building and hosting a separate service for each one.

## The problem

Customers have different jobs for agents to do. Today, getting one running involves more than describing the task: someone needs to connect its inputs and tools, run it, retain its state, and make its work understandable.

We want a shared product and backend that handles those responsibilities so a customer can create an agent by configuring its behavior and connecting it to an AgentMail inbox. **AgentMail is the only connector for this trial:** use its API for inbox and message access, and its incoming-email events to trigger agents.

## Who is the customer?

Build for someone configuring and operating email agents for their team or customers. They know the job they want done and need a product that handles the setup and execution. Different users will bring different instructions, context, and workflows. For example:

- A billing agent might process invoices and CC the appropriate people.
- A support agent might investigate an incoming issue and identify which engineer to CC.

These illustrate different uses of the same infrastructure. The product should support customer-defined behavior through configuration and the supplied harness, without changes to application code for each use case.

Rho, an AgentMail customer whose team wants to create agents for its customers, is one example of this need. The platform should work across customers and use cases.

The [example scenarios](fixtures/company.md) and inputs are synthetic. They are starting configurations to try, not business rules to hardcode into the product.

## What we'd like you to build

Build this as a **Managed Agents** destination in the sidebar of an existing console. Assume the user is already logged in and has an AgentMail workspace with inboxes. Use the supplied console shell; focus on the agent experience inside it.

Someone should be able to **create an agent, define its behavior, connect an inbox, and inspect the work triggered by incoming email**.

The user should be able to:

- Create agents with different instructions and connect them to an AgentMail inbox and the supplied AgentMail tools.
- Have an incoming AgentMail `message.received` event trigger the appropriate agent through the execution harness.
- Understand its progress, inspect its input, output and tool activity, and see when execution fails.
- Return later and find saved agents and their results.

Demonstrate two differently configured agents using the same creation, event-triggered execution, and inspection flow. Billing and support are supplied examples; neither requires a separate screen, API, or business-specific implementation.

Use the supplied AgentMail API adapter and local event delivery/replay tooling. Replayed email events must enter the same backend event-handling path used by the AgentMail integration; an event should start a run without someone pressing Run in the UI.

## Scope

Build a working Next.js frontend and backend with application data persisted in Postgres. You own the configuration experience, schema, APIs, validation, and execution integration.

Execution within the local event-handler request is acceptable. Decide how to handle failures and repeated events within the available time, and explain the limitations of your approach.

Keep the infrastructure bounded: one existing workspace, AgentMail inboxes and email events, and the supplied harness and AgentMail toolset. Generalize across email-agent use cases within AgentMail. Other connectors, a connector marketplace, arbitrary-code hosting, a visual workflow builder, authentication, and deployment are outside scope. Record external actions through local stubs; do not send real email or execute payments.

## Questions to consider

- What does a customer need to configure to create a useful agent? What can be handled for them?
- How does a user connect an inbox and understand which incoming emails will trigger their agent?
- Which concepts belong to the shared platform, and which belong in an agent's configuration?
- How can someone understand what an unfamiliar agent did and whether it succeeded?
- How does your system behave if an input arrives twice or an execution is retried?
- What should happen when an agent's instructions or available tools change?
- Can another use case fit without changing the application's schema or adding a dedicated workflow?

## Working together

Start by exploring the examples and sketching a user flow and technical approach. We'll discuss them together, then you will spend most of the session building.

Use us as teammates: ask questions, challenge assumptions, and tell us when something blocks you. Before the end, we'll have someone try the product so you can observe it and make an adjustment.

At the end, show the working experience and walk through the decisions behind it. Keep brief [design notes](DECISIONS.md) and the commands needed to run and check your work. You may use AI tools, libraries, and existing components; be ready to explain and modify what you build.

## Development environment

Use Next.js and TypeScript, Postgres, and the supplied local execution harness. We provide a console shell with an assumed logged-in workspace, database access, model access, the AgentMail API adapter, sample inboxes/messages, and local webhook delivery/replay tooling. Local simulation uses the same integration contract and does not require a public webhook URL or AWS deployment. You choose the application architecture.

See [setup](docs/SETUP.md) and [the harness contract](docs/HARNESS.md) for their preparation status. Keep credentials on the server and out of source control.
